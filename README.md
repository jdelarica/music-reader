Musical Image Recognition has been the subject of research for decades. Its traditional application has been the extraction of existing printed sheet music to digitized formats. The aim of this project is to learn and train certain skills in the field of image processing, instead of creating a complete musical image recognition software.

An accessible and easy-to-use application in this area would improve and provide an amazing tool for improving the musical education experience. The main goal of the project is to develop the algorithms needed to parse digital sheet music images and to provide a playback system for the parsed music notes.

A theoretical background is explained below, in which all the necessary steps and musical theory are shown.

First, some musical theory as the compasses and the difference between the black and white notes are explained. It is also shown a state of the art and a block diagram of the whole software to deliver a proper explanation and a big picture of the project.

Next, the different computed functions are explained one by one, as to understand the whole functionality and need of each one.

Finally, some final results and examples are shown in order to explain the functionality of the software.
